 /* Tests basic lock functionality. Worker 1 is forked at priority 6, acquires
 * lock and forks Worker 2 a higher priority. Worker 2 should then block on lock 
 * until Worker 1 releases lock, then continue. The "flag" variable is to 
 * test that the workers ran in the correct order.
 *
 * Expected output:

    Worker 1 starting.
    Worker 1 acquiring the lock.
    Worker 1 now has the lock.
    Worker 1 forking Worker 2.
    Worker 2 starting.
    Worker 2 acquiring the lock.
    Worker 1 incrementing flag.
    Worker 1 releasing the lock.
    Worker 2 now has the lock.
    Worker 2 testing value of flag.
    Worker 2 modifying value of flag.
    Worker 2 releasing the lock.
    Worker 2 done.
    Worker 1 done.
    No runnable processes, halting.
    TEST PASSED.
